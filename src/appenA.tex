Fonts should be easily readable and at least 11~pt in size. Line spacing should be single spaced and facilitate readability with no more than six lines per inch. If using notes and figures in the side margin as is done with the {\ttfamily fancy} class option of {\ttfamily byuthesis.cls} the space between the text column and the side margin column must be at least 0.125~inches and the space between the side margin column and the edge of the page must be at least 0.75~inches. 

\item {\bfseries Page numbering:} Preliminary matter should be numbered with lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, and so forth). Main matter beginning with the first page of the first chapter should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals starting with 1.

\item {\bfseries References:} Works cited in the document should be included in a list of references after the last chapter and before appendices. Reference should be cited in the text using a standard format such as (author, year) or by number (e.g., [1]). The list of references should follow a standard format and must include sufficient information for the work to be located. 

\item {\bfseries Equations:} Displayed equations should be numbered in the format (chapter.number), so that the first equation in chapter 2 is numbered (2.1) and referenced in the text in the same format. 

\item {\bfseries Figures and tables} should be numbered in the format Figure chapter.number, as in Figure 2.1 or Table 3.2. Figures should include a descriptive caption below the figure. Tables should include a descriptive title above the table.

Colors of text should be limited to black, grey (0x666666), navy blue (0x002E5D), and royal blue (0x005CAB) as specified by university style guides at \url{https://brand.byu.edu/colors}.
