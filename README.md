# BYU College of Engineering LaTeX thesis and dissertation template

The template itself explains the usage and formatting rules for the thesis/dissertation according to university and department guidelines [todo: add link to guidelines].  See the compiled pdf [todo: add link to it].

Note that even with the automated formatting with LaTeX, there may still be some small formatting thing that require manual fine-tuning for the final product. The department graduate advisor will point out any such things during the review process.
