\chapter{Document Formatting}
\label{ap:formatting}

\section{Font Selection}
	Font must be a conservative serif-styled font (e.g., Palatino, Times New Roman, Garamond), size 11 pt. The font style and size must be consistent throughout the text. 10 pt. font is allowed for figure and text captions. The font size for figures should be no smaller than 8 pt. and easily legible.

	\section{Document Margins}
	Front matter pages (title page, abstract page, acknowledgment page)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1-inch top and bottom margins
		\item 2-inch left and right margins
	\end{itemize}

	\noindent Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, body pages
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1-inch top and bottom margins
		\item 2-inch left and right margins
	\end{itemize}

	\noindent Chapter title pages, reference title page, appendix title pages
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2-inch top margin
		\item 1-inch bottom margin
		\item 2-inch left and right margins
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Printing Instructions}
	Not all departments require a printed and bound copy of the thesis document. If a bound copy of the document is required, it should be printed double-sided. Please note that following pages must begin on recto page: title, abstract, acknowledgment, table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, chapter title, references, and appendix title.

	\section{Page Numbering}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Page numbers are centered at the bottom of the page.
		\item Counting begins with the title page
		\item Page numbers do not appear until after the table of contents.
		\item Use Roman numerals (e.g., i, ii, iii, etc.) for the table of contents and the pages thereafter until Chapter 1 begins.
		\item Use Arabic numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3 etc.) beginning with Chapter 1. Be sure numbers appear on {\em all} non-blank pages once numbering begins.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Line Spacing}
	The document should be single spaced with the exception of space around titles, headings, subheadings, figures, tables, and equations as described below. Please note that the document style of this template  has been defined to conform to these requirements.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two-inch margin above chapter titles (144 pts).
		\item One inch of space after chapter titles (72 pts).
		\item 18 pts before level 2 subheadings.
		\item 6 pts after level 2 subheadings.
		\item 12 pts before level 3 subheadings.
		\item 3 pts after level 3 subheadings.
		\item 12 pts (1 carriage return with 11-pt font) before figures
		\item 9 pts between figure and caption, 15 pts between figure and following text.
		\item 9 pts before table caption, 3 pts between caption and table.
		\item 12 pts between table and following text.
		\item 6 pts before and after equations.
		\item Do not leave a single line of text or a subheading alone on the top (widow) or bottom (orphan) of a page.
		\item Do not leave more than 1 inch of extra white space remaining on the bottom of a page unless it is at the end of a chapter. An exception to this rule is for pages containing no text and only figures and tables.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Figure Formatting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Figures are typically diagrams, graphs, pictures, maps, or charts.
		\item Center figures on the page.
		\item Center captions below the figure. If multiple lines are needed, the caption should be left/right justified at the margins.
		\item A figure should be placed after the paragraph in which it is first referenced. If it will not fit on the same page, continue the text and place the figure at the top of the next page.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Table Formatting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Tables typically contain numerical or statistical information.
		\item Center tables on the page.
		\item Center captions above the table, not to exceed the width of the table. If multiple lines are needed, the caption should be left/right justified at the margins, such as
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent Table 6.3: Comparison of roll rotation plots when spatial node was displaced, and an X-direction force was applied.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If placed in the landscape position, the top of the table should be on the left side of the page, with the caption above the table. The page number is placed underneath the table.
	\end{itemize}
