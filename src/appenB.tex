\chapter{Electronic Document Submission}
\label{ap:elect_doc}

The university requires all dissertations and theses to be submitted electronically as a PDF document. All required fonts should be embedded in the PDF document to ensure that your document will appear as intended wherever it is viewed. You can verify that all fonts are appropriately embedded by opening your PDF document in Adobe Acrobat Reader and selecting {\ttfamily{File->Properties}}. Under the Font tab, you should see a list of the fonts used in your document. To ensure that all fonts are embedded, they should be designated as ``Embedded'' or ``Embedded Subset'' in the list.

\section{PDF Bookmarks}
The PDF document must contain bookmarks for preliminary pages plus chapter headings and subheadings, as listed in the Table of Contents. In the PDF document, bookmarks should be displayed in a panel to the left of the document pages as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:PDF_doc}.

If assistance is needed with embedding, bookmarks, or other aspects of submitting the ETD, you may obtain assistance at the Multimedia Lab in the HBLL. Please note that keywords for your research will be required at the time you submit your document. Keywords must be in lower case, unless they are acronyms or proper nouns. In addition, a copy of the abstract must be inserted. Helpful information on submitting your ETD copy can be found at \url{https://gradprogress.sim.byu.edu/resources}.

\section{Miscellaneous Filler}
Most appendices will be longer than 3/4 of a page. We'll use some Latin to fill this one out. {\color{mediumgray} \blindtext}
