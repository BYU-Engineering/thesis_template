# BYU College of Engineering LaTeX thesis and dissertation template

The template itself explains the usage and formatting rules for the thesis/dissertation according to [university](TODO:need_to_add_link) and [department](TODO:need_to_add_link) guidelines.  See the compiled pdfs of the [fancy](src/fancy_example_template.pdf) and [simple](src/simple_example_template.pdf).

Note that even with the automated formatting with LaTeX, there may still be some small formatting thing that require manual fine-tuning for the final product. The department graduate advisor will point out any such things during the review process.
