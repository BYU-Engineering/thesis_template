This is a LaTeX template for formatting theses and dissertations for submission in the Brigham Young University College of Engineering. The template feature options for simple or fancy formatting.

This template was created using the memoir class as a foundation. If you are interested in adding or modifying features of the template, you will likely find it useful to consult the memoir.cls documentation (memman.pdf) at  http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/memman.pdf

The template also uses biblatex for formatting citations and the bibliography. Documentation for biblatex can be found at https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf
